            <p>Hello, my name is Michael Bowman I am married with 3 kids.
         I am a Marine Corps veteran, shortly after leaving the military I started into the field of trucking and logistics.
          I have been a logistics coordinator for the last 8 years. 
          I started to pursue a degree to further my knowledge on multiple fronts such as project management, software engineering, and web development.
           BYU Pathway had a professional studies degree that allowed me to have a broader scope of study which fit well with the things i wanted to learn.
            I am excited to participate in this course with all of you.
            </p>
